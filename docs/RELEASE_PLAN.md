## üîÑ YNAB Data Mapping

### Monthly to Weekly Conversion

```typescript
// Conceptual data transformation from monthly to weekly
const convertMonthlyToWeekly = (monthlyData: YNABMonthlyData, weekRange: DateRange): WeeklyBudgetData => {
  // 1. Calculate days in month
  const daysInMonth = getDaysInMonth(monthlyData.month);
  
  // 2. Calculate days in selected week
  const daysInWeek = getDaysInRange(weekRange);
  
  // 3. Calculate proportion for budget allocation
  const weekProportion = daysInWeek / daysInMonth;
  
  // 4. Apply proportion to budget categories
  const weeklyCategories = monthlyData.categories.map(category => ({
    id: category.id,
    name: category.name,
    budgeted: category.budgeted * weekProportion,
    spent: calculateSpentInDateRange(category.activity, weekRange),
    remaining: calculateRemainingForWeek(category, weekProportion, weekRange),
    transactions: getTransactionsInDateRange(category.id, weekRange)
  }));
  
  // 5. Aggregate daily spending
  const dailySpending = aggregateDailySpending(
    monthlyData.transactions,
    weekRange
  );
  
  // 6. Return transformed data
  return {
    totalBudget: calculateTotalBudget(weeklyCategories),
    totalSpent: calculateTotalSpent(weeklyCategories),
    remainingBudget: calculateRemainingBudget(weeklyCategories),
    categories: weeklyCategories,
    dailySpending,
