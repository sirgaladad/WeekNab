# WeekNab Weekly View Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Weekly View feature is the core functionality of WeekNab, breaking down monthly YNAB budgets into weekly insights. This guide explains the implementation details and how to integrate the feature into the existing WeekNab application.

## Files Structure

1. **Components**:
   - `src/components/budget/WeeklyView.vue` - The main component for the weekly view
   - `src/views/WeeklyBudgetView.vue` - The route component that integrates WeeklyView
   - `src/views/TransactionsView.vue` - Detailed transaction view with filtering capabilities

2. **Services**:
   - `src/services/ynab-weekly.service.ts` - Extension of the YNAB service with weekly-specific functionality

3. **Router Updates**:
   - Added routes for `/budgets/:id/weekly` and `/budgets/:id/transactions`

## Architecture

The Weekly View architecture follows a hierarchical pattern:

```
BudgetDetailView
    └── Link to WeeklyBudgetView
         └── WeeklyView Component
              └── Link to TransactionsView (filtered by category)
```

## Key Features

1. **Weekly Budget Breakdown**: 
   - Divides monthly budget into weekly allocations
   - Shows spending progress relative to the weekly budget

2. **Category Analysis**:
   - Displays categories with weekly budget vs. actual spending
   - Visual indicators for over-budget categories
   - Filtering options (All, Over Budget, Under Budget, Essential)

3. **Transaction Preview**:
   - Shows recent transactions for each category
   - Links to a dedicated transaction view for more details

4. **Weekly Insights**:
   - Highlights top spending categories
   - Identifies over-budget areas
   - Surfaces savings opportunities

## Implementation Steps

1. **Install the New Components**:
   - Create the file structure as outlined above
   - Add the components to your project

2. **Update Router Configuration**:
   - Add the new routes as shown in the router update

3. **Modify BudgetDetailView**:
   - Add action buttons to navigate to the Weekly View

4. **Data Flow**:
   - YNAB API → ynab.service.ts → ynab-weekly.service.ts → WeeklyView.vue

## Mobile Optimizations

The Weekly View is designed with a mobile-first approach:

1. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Single column layout on small screens
   - Grid layout on larger screens

2. **Touch-Friendly Elements**:
   - Large tap targets for buttons and interactive elements
   - Swipe-friendly navigation

3. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Collapsible transaction details
   - Focused information architecture

## Weekly Calculation Logic

1. **Determining Weeks in Month**:
   - Count the number of weeks (Monday-Sunday) in the current month
   - Handle partial weeks at month start/end

2. **Weekly Budget Allocation**:
   - Divide monthly category budgets by the number of weeks
   - Account for uneven distribution if necessary

3. **Tracking Weekly Spending**:
   - Filter transactions by date range for current week
   - Sum amounts by category

## Best Practices

1. **Performance**:
   - Use computed properties for derived data
   - Implement efficient filtering and sorting

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Provide meaningful labels for all interactive elements
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Support keyboard navigation

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clear visual feedback for actions
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Helpful empty states

## Testing Considerations

1. **Data Scenarios**:
   - Test with various budget configurations
   - Verify calculation accuracy
   - Check edge cases (zero budget, over-budget)

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Test across different screen sizes
   - Validate all interactive elements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Date Range Selection**:
   - Allow users to select specific weeks or date ranges

2. **Spending Trends**:
   - Show week-over-week comparisons
   - Visualize spending patterns over time

3. **Budget Adjustments**:
   - Allow users to adjust weekly allocations
   - Provide suggested reallocations based on spending patterns

4. **Export & Sharing**:
   - Enable exporting weekly reports
   - Share insights with others
