## 🧠 Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| April 2024 | Adopted component-based architecture | Improves maintainability and reusability |
| April 2024 | Selected Supabase for backend | Provides authentication, database, and storage |
| April 2024 | Implemented dark theme by default | Better user experience for financial application |
| May 2024 | Created DemoDataService separate from API service | Allows development without API dependency |

## 🚧 Known Issues & Risks

1. **YNAB API Dependency**
   - Risk: API changes could break functionality
   - Mitigation: Implement adapter pattern, monitor changes

2. **Data Transformation Complexity**
   - Risk: Monthly to weekly conversion edge cases
   - Mitigation: Robust testing, clear documentation

3. **User Authentication Security**
   - Risk: Securing YNAB personal tokens
   - Mitigation: Use proper auth flow, secure token storage
